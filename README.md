# LinkedIn Flagging Extension âœ…

A Chrome extension that allows users to flag suspicious LinkedIn profiles for **fake job postings**, **severe flirting**, or **spam content**. The extension uses **OCR.space API** to extract text from uploaded screenshots and **Gemini API** to analyze the content for potential issues.

This is a prototype extension built for demonstration purposes and does not track users or display detailed information about flags.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The user selects a reason (**Fake Job** or **Flirty Message**) from the dropdown.
2. The user uploads a screenshot related to the profile.
3. The extension sends the screenshot to **OCR.space API**, which extracts the text from the image.
4. The extracted text is sent to **Gemini API**, which classifies the content.
5. Based on the classification, the extension shows the appropriate flag icon and message.
